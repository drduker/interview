# Request for Discussion: Secure Artifact Manager

## 1. Problem Statement

We need to build a secure artifact storage and validation system that allows users to upload, scan, verify, and download binary artifacts with appropriate security guarantees. The system must provide mechanisms for tracking metadata, performing security scans, and accessing artifacts securely. The solution needs to be containerized and deployable to a local Kubernetes cluster.

## 2. Proposed Solution

I propose building a comprehensive artifact management system with a React/TypeScript frontend, Go backend, and Kubernetes deployment targeting Level 3 functionality. The system will feature a clean separation of concerns with security built in from the ground up rather than as an afterthought.

### 2.1 System Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React/TypeScript SPA with strong type safety
   - State management using React Context API and hooks
   - Material UI components for a clean, responsive design
   - Client-side validation and secure communication with backend

2. **Backend API Service**
   - Go-based RESTful API with structured error handling
   - Clean architecture with separation of concerns:
     - Controllers: HTTP request handling
     - Services: Business logic
     - Repositories: Data access
     - Models: Domain entities

3. **Storage Service**
   - Persistent storage for artifacts using Kubernetes PVCs
   - Metadata storage in PostgreSQL database
   - Temporary storage for scan operations

4. **Security Scanner**
   - Integration with Trivy for vulnerability scanning
   - Custom scan result processing and reporting
   - Scan queue management for asynchronous operations

5. **Authentication Service**
   - JWT-based authentication with proper token management
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure password handling with bcrypt

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. User uploads an artifact through the frontend
2. Backend validates the upload and stores the artifact temporarily
3. System generates metadata (size, hash, etc.)
4. Security scanner analyzes the artifact for vulnerabilities
5. Results are stored and associated with the artifact
6. Artifact is moved to permanent storage if it passes configured policies
7. Users with appropriate permissions can access the artifact and related metadata

## 3. Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### 3.1 Backend Language: Go

**Decision**: Use Go for the backend implementation.

**Rationale**:
- Strong typing and memory safety
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Built-in concurrency primitives for handling multiple scan operations
- Robust standard library with strong HTTP server capabilities
- Compiles to static binaries ideal for containerization

**Tradeoffs**:
- Less extensive ecosystem compared to Node.js
- Steeper learning curve for developers familiar with dynamic languages

### 3.2 Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a hybrid storage approach with filesystem for artifacts and PostgreSQL for metadata.

**Rationale**:
- Efficient storage of binary artifacts on filesystem
- Structured queries and relationships for metadata
- Separation allows for optimization of each storage type
- PostgreSQL provides transaction support and complex queries

**Tradeoffs**:
- More complex deployment compared to using a single storage solution
- Need to maintain consistency between filesystem and database

### 3.3 Authentication Mechanism

**Decision**: Implement JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens and refresh mechanisms.

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication reduces server load
- Enables scaling across multiple backend instances
- Fine-grained control over token expiration and validation
- Ability to revoke access when needed

**Tradeoffs**:
- More complex token management compared to session-based auth
- Need for secure storage of tokens on client side

### 3.4 Artifact Scanning

**Decision**: Use Trivy for vulnerability scanning with a custom wrapper service.

**Rationale**:
- Industry-standard scanner with regular updates
- Supports multiple artifact types (container images, packages)
- Can be containerized and integrated into our architecture
- Provides comprehensive vulnerability reports

**Tradeoffs**:
- External dependency needs to be maintained
- Potential rate limiting for large scan volumes
- Need to handle and interpret scan results properly

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Artifact Integrity

- Calculate and verify SHA256 hashes for all artifacts
- Implement artifact signing using x509 certificates
- Verify signatures before allowing download
- Maintain audit logs of all verification attempts

### 4.2 Access Controls

- Implement fine-grained RBAC with the following roles:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - Publisher: Can upload and manage artifacts
  - Consumer: Can download approved artifacts
  - Auditor: Can view scan reports and logs
- Enforce least privilege principle
- Implement IP-based access restrictions (configurable)

### 4.3 API Security

- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- HTTPS only with TLS 1.2+ and strong cipher suites
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Audit logging of all API requests

### 4.4 Storage Security

- Encrypt artifacts at rest using AES-256
- Secure delete operations
- Access logging for all storage operations
- Strict file permissions in containers

### 4.5 Container Security

- Minimal base images (distroless for Go backend)
- Regular security updates
- No unnecessary packages
- Non-root user execution
- ReadOnly file systems where possible
- Drop all capabilities except those explicitly needed

## 5. Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

### 5.1 Cluster Architecture

- Local Kind cluster with a single control plane and two worker nodes
- Separate namespaces for application components
- NetworkPolicies to restrict inter-service communication
- Resource quotas and limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### 5.2 Component Deployment

- **Frontend**: Deployment with 2 replicas, served through Ingress
- **Backend API**: Deployment with 3 replicas, internal Service
- **Storage Service**: StatefulSet with persistent volumes
- **Scanner**: Deployment with dedicated resources
- **Database**: StatefulSet with persistent storage

### 5.3 Infrastructure Components

- Ingress Controller with TLS termination
- Cert-Manager for certificate management
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Loki for log aggregation

### 5.4 Deployment Process

- Helm charts for templated deployment
- ConfigMaps for configuration
- Secrets for sensitive data (managed securely)
- Health checks and readiness probes for all components
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 5.5 Resource Requirements

| Component | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Memory Request | Memory Limit |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Frontend  | 100m       | 200m      | 128Mi         | 256Mi       |
| Backend   | 200m       | 500m      | 256Mi         | 512Mi       |
| Scanner   | 500m       | 1000m     | 512Mi         | 1Gi         |
| Database  | 200m       | 500m      | 512Mi         | 1Gi         |
